            <div class="text-box">
                <p data-translate="about_text_1">We are dedicated to improving the environment by planting trees in Miami. Our mission is to create a greener, healthier city for all residents and visitors. We believe in the power of community and the importance of engaging with local residents to make a lasting impact. By working together, we can transform urban spaces into lush, green areas that provide numerous benefits for both people and wildlife.</p>
                <p data-translate="about_text_2">Our organization was founded by a group of passionate environmentalists who saw the need for more green spaces in Miami. Over the years, we have grown into a dedicated team of volunteers and supporters who share our vision of a greener city. We have partnered with local schools, businesses, and government agencies to plant thousands of trees across Miami, creating beautiful, sustainable environments for future generations to enjoy.</p>
                <p data-translate="about_text_3">Our tree planting initiatives focus on areas that are most in need of green spaces, such as underserved neighborhoods and urban heat islands. By strategically planting trees in these areas, we can help reduce air pollution, lower temperatures, and improve overall quality of life for residents. In addition to tree planting, we also provide education and resources to help the community understand the importance of trees and how to care for them.</p>
                <p data-translate="about_text_4">Join us in our mission to make Miami a greener, healthier place to live. Whether you want to volunteer your time, donate to support our efforts, or simply learn more about the benefits of trees, we welcome you to be a part of our growing community.</p>
