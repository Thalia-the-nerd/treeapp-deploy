                        <p>The Gumbo Limbo, affectionately known as the "Tourist Tree" due to its distinctive red, peeling bark that resembles sunburned tourists, is a beloved native tree of South Florida. This versatile tree has been a vital part of Miami's ecosystem for centuries, known for its rapid growth, beautiful copper-colored bark, and remarkable adaptability to Miami's unique climate.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Historical Significance:</h4>
                        <p>Indigenous peoples used the Gumbo Limbo's resin for various medicinal purposes, earning it the nickname "the healing tree." Its wood was traditionally used for making furniture and canoes, while its bark was used in traditional medicine.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Growing Conditions:</h4>
                        <p>Perfectly suited for Miami's climate, the Gumbo Limbo thrives in our sandy soils and salty conditions. It's particularly well-adapted to coastal areas and can withstand hurricane-force winds, making it an excellent choice for urban landscaping in South Florida.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Benefits:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fast-growing shade tree (can grow up to 3 feet per year)</li>
                            <li>Attracts birds, butterflies, and other wildlife</li>
                            <li>Excellent salt and wind tolerance</li>
                            <li>Low maintenance once established</li>
                            <li>Drought resistant</li>
                            <li>Natural air purifier</li>
                            <li>Helps reduce urban heat island effect</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Care Instructions:</h4>
                        <p>While the Gumbo Limbo is relatively low-maintenance, here are some tips for optimal growth:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Plant in well-draining soil</li>
                            <li>Water regularly during first year</li>
                            <li>Prune only to remove dead or damaged branches</li>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p data-translate="about_text_1">We are dedicated to improving the environment by planting trees in Miami. Our mission is to create a greener, healthier city for all residents and visitors. We believe in the power of community and the importance of engaging with local residents to make a lasting impact. By working together, we can transform urban spaces into lush, green areas that provide numerous benefits for both people and wildlife.</p>
                <p data-translate="about_text_2">Our organization was founded by a group of passionate environmentalists who saw the need for more green spaces in Miami. Over the years, we have grown into a dedicated team of volunteers and supporters who share our vision of a greener city. We have partnered with local schools, businesses, and government agencies to plant thousands of trees across Miami, creating beautiful, sustainable environments for future generations to enjoy.</p>
                <p data-translate="about_text_3">Our tree planting initiatives focus on areas that are most in need of green spaces, such as underserved neighborhoods and urban heat islands. By strategically planting trees in these areas, we can help reduce air pollution, lower temperatures, and improve overall quality of life for residents. In addition to tree planting, we also provide education and resources to help the community understand the importance of trees and how to care for them.</p>
                <p data-translate="about_text_4">Join us in our mission to make Miami a greener, healthier place to live. Whether you want to volunteer your time, donate to support our efforts, or simply learn more about the benefits of trees, we welcome you to be a part of our growing community.</p>
